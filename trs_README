1. Server ----------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile and run the server:
	$ make server
	$ ./server

Once you start the server, you are in a command-line admin panel.
The server is not initially listening on a socket. You must type /START to start
listening. Once you type /START, the server will be listening on port 9034,
which clients are configured with.

Other commands for the admin are:
/STATS			See stats about users and chat rooms.
/END			Close all active chat rooms.
/THROWOUT <user_fd>	End user's chat room.
/BLOCK <user_fd>	Prevent user from joining any chat room.
/UNBLOCK <user_fd>	Allow user to join chat rooms.
/HELP			Show this message.

Note that the admin specifies users by their file descriptors, since they are
necessarily unique. For this reason, the usernames for clients need not be
unique.

The TRS server allows for a maximum of 10 clients - chatting or not - to be in
the queue at once.

2. Client ----------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile and run the client, you must provide the TRS server's hostname:
	$ make client
	$ ./client trs_server_hostname

If the admin running the server has not yet typed /START, there will be nothing
to connect to, and the client program will quit.

If the TRS server is listening, a TCP connection will be opened. However, you
are not yet connected/tracked for chatting.

To connect for chatting, you must log in by typing /CONNECT <username>. There is
no restriction on your username, other than a generous maximum length.

After successfully logging in, you can type /CHAT to express interest in
chatting. You will be paired with the first available user.

While chatting, you can type /QUIT to exit the chat. You will then need to type
/CHAT again to chat with someone else.

While chatting, you can type /TRANSFER <filepath> to transfer a file to your
chat partner. You can only transfer files up to 100MB large.
